# Let's Start EllipticCurve  
We often reffer Wikipedia; What's EllipticCurve? or How calculate on the EllipticCurve?  
You can't master EllipticCurve completely by reading it.  
It shows just a logic. The best way to master is by practice.  

## Why EllipticCurve?  
Worth lerning.  


## Why don't you use sageMath?  
You must be kidding.


# Features  

## Simple Usage  

```
a := Str2Int("14", 10) // convert to *big.Int
b := Str2Int("7", 10)
p := Str2int("19", 10)

EC := New(a, b, p) // Define an EllipticCurve; y^2 = x^3 + ax + b (mod p)
```
